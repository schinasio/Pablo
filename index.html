	<h2>Pablo's story</h2>

	<p>
		The above images document the honorable attempt of an ordinary chewing gum called
Pablo to break out of the system and draw the line of his own life.</p>

<p>If based in the pictures you are seeing Pablo’s attempt as unsuccessful, you don’t understand
his mind. He set up for a change and he achieved just that. Pablo’s point was not extinguishing the
fire that is burning in his candy heart, he wanted to show what he believes in, and he found the
ultimate success.
Since he was young, Pablo wanted change. Once, when he was a teenage gum living in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(gum)">chewing gum factory</a>, he tried to remove his clothes labeling him as who he is, but the system relabeled him
tightly with it’s quick, metallic and cold hands.
Pablo chose death over serving his owners.
The only thing that he couldn’t achieve is death,
Pablo will remain alive in every candy’s heart.
<p><strong>In memoriam Pablo</strong></p>
